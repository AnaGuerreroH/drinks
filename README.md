# drinks

Hi, I'm Anita Guerrero and this is my project "Drinks" for my previous interview on Wizeline.

I want to include a very small brief about what I did for this project.

1.- A main fragment where you can see the app title, a search bar and a list of drinks.
2.- At first, you can see a random drink.
3.- You can write in the search bar and this will call to a web service that will responde with a list of drinks. This will update the list of drinks in real time.
4.- You can tap in any drink and see it detail. This detail contains the drink, thumbnail and description of this selected drink.

All this project is based on this web page "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/"

Here you can see an example of the final version of this project.

Thank you!
